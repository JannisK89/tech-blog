# Javascript Level Up - Part 1 - The Prototype Chain

Remember when I said that I would update this blog once every 2 weeks?  
I hope not because as you may notice the last post was almost a year ago. __Whoops.__


Well worry not because I will be closing this year with a bang. A series of posts about knowledge
all Javascript devs should have but that I unfortunately see lacking all too often. Hopefully this will make
up for my lack of posts, nobody warned me how little free time you have when you have an infant (actually, 
pretty much everybody warned me about this but I thought they were exaggerating.. Turns out they weren't).

Enough yammering, let's get started!


## The Prototype Chain
Lets take a look at some code.
```js 
const hero = {
  name: 'Guts',
  weapon: 'Greatsword',
  swing: function() { console.log(`${this.name} swings a ${this.weapon}`) }
}

hero.swing()
```

Pretty straight forward, we create an object that has 2 properties: name and weapon. It also has 
a method called swing that logs the fact that they swing their weapon to the console.  
And when we then call the method we get our little message printed to the console (try pasting the code into
the browsers console if you want to test without whipping out your code editor).

"_Guts swings a Greatsword_"

Working as expected right? Nothing strange at all about that I would say. Now what happens if we try to call 
__hero.roar()__ on our hero object? We get an error that .roar() is not a function. Still I would say that 
it is exactly as we expected since we never created it.

Now how about we call __hero.toString()__? Hmm strange, that returns an object, even though we never
created a toString method for our object. And that is due to...

### Prototypal inheritance
A prototype in Javascript in like a blueprint that your object will inherit from. Let's keep on 
with our hero example and let's create an object that inherits from our Hero object.

```js 
const villain =  Object.create(hero)
```

Now if we type __villain__ in our browser console we see that it is an empty object. What happens if we
try to call __.swing()__ on our villain object? 

It logs: "_Guts swings a Greatsword_"

But how does that work when our villain object was just an empty object? It's because we are inhereting from
our prototype the hero object. Try typing __villain.\_\_proto\_\___ into the browsers console. It returns
the hero object with name, weapon and the swing method.

But our villain is not guts, let's change that.
```js 
villain.name = 'Griffith'
villain.weapon = 'Saber'
```

and we run __villain.swing()__ and..

"_Griffith swings a Saber_"

Now if we enter our villain object into the console we get \{name: "Griffith", weapon: "Saber"\} and we know
that we get the Swing method from the hero object we inhereted from. But let try typing __villain.\_\_proto\_\___
again.

It's still our hero object, the name is still Guts and the weapon is still Greatsword but we
logged that Griffith was swinging his saber which brings us to..

## Climbing the prototype chain
The way Javascript works is that when you call a function or try to get a property from an object it will
start climbing the prototype chain. In the case of __villain.name__ it will enter our villain object, find name
and use that. Which is why swing() uses the name from villain once we added it instead of the name from
hero that was in the prototype which it inherits from.

Now when we call __.swing()__ on our villain object it will check villain, find nothing there then climb
the prototype chain to hero where it fill find the method swing() and use that.

Great, glad we solved where those two come from, but we still haven't answered one question. Where did
__.toString()__ come from and why does that work on our hero and our villain object?

See every object in Javascript has a standard object prototype which contains things like __.toString()__ 
, __.hasOwnProperty()__ etc so everytime you create an object using squigly brackets you automatically get these 
methods. In our case it will:
1. Enter into villain, find nothing and climb up the prototype chain to hero.
1. Enter into hero, find nothing and climb up the prototype chain to Object.
1. Enter into Object, find __.toString()__ and call it.

But what happens if we try to get a property that does not exist, like __.helloWorld__?
Once again we will climb the chain, untill we get to the top. If nothing was found, it means that
the property has not been defined and we get the source of nightmares for many Javascript devs __Undefined__.
